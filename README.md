# Logo-Generator   [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This is a repository for a Node.js command-line application that generates a logo based on user input. The application was created in order to quickly generate a logo using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for freelance developers who might need logos for their projects. The application will be run using Node.js, will prompt the user to select a color, shape, and provide a text for the logo. The logo will be saved to a generated SVG file which can be exported as an image file. As a software developer, from creating this application, I was able to learn and understand how to create graphics using SVG as well as enhance my understanding of Object Oriented Programming by creating classes and Test Driven Development by creating automated tests that will ease the manual burden of testing.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you will first need to install the files onto your local machine. Simply download the 'index.js', 'package-lock.json', 'package.json', and the entire lib folder from this repository. Make sure that all the downloaded files are within the same directory. Then you can proceed to the usage section on how to execute the code

## Usage

In order to use this application, you will need to follow the instructions on how to install the files. Once the files and folders have been downloaded to your local machine and are located within the same directory, you can open gitbash or the command line and execute the 'index.js' file with the precondition that Node.js is installed on your device. From the command line you will need to cd into the folder where the files are located. Then, you can execute the program with the syntax 'node index.js'. This will execute the program and you will be prompted to answer questions regarding your logo. After answering all the questions, a 'logo.svg' file will be created under the examples folder. You will be able to open the file and export it as an image file if you choose to do so. An video example of how to use the application can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15haB-wc1rvr3NhHTiEqfOB8ifkEc890I/view)

## Credits 

I would like give credit to my tutor Joem Casusi for helping me with the issues I was having regarding how to use object classes as parameters to create objects within another class. Additionally, I would like to give him credit with helping me design the tests.
